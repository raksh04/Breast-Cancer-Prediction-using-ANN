# Breast Cancer Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

**This Project is based on the application of deep multilayer neural networks.**

## Project Outline
* Performed Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.
* Built a n-layer Artificial Neural Network with 1.00 accuracy to predict the type of tumor.
* Created functions for forward propagation and backward propagation, relu and sigmoid activation functions were used for hidden layer and output layer respectively.
